# calc-dates
Node CLI app to calculate the whole number of days between two dates. Note the from and to dates are excluded from this calculation (e.g. by this calculation there is 1 whole day between 01/01/2001 and 03/01/2001).

You will be prompted to enter the from and to dates seperately, each in the format DD/MM/YYY. The calculated number of whole days between the two dates will then be logged to the terminal window.
